\section{Introduction}

Hostel is a pretty popular system of living in study life for most of the students, also for bachelors too. One of the main reasons of this being popular is that its very cheap. But unfortunately, all the way of renting hostels in this 2022 era is still very backwards. But we are here to change that with our hostel rental system website.

\section{Objective}

\begin{itemize}
  \item To easily get to know about all the available hostels around 
  \item Get to know the features of those hostels
  \item Get to know the rent amount
  \item Cab contact owner directly

  \item Online booking system
\end{itemize}

\section{Target Customers}

  \item Owners who wants to level up the hostel business
\end{itemize}

\section{Value Proposition}

\end{itemize}

\section{Challenge}
There will be quite a few challenges while building and distributing this app, and the biggest challenge will be getting hostel owner onboard with this idea. For this to idea to work hostel owners need to be onboard but most of the owners are old and backdated who doesn’t understands technology that much because of that we will have to go to every individual and make them understand of the future.
